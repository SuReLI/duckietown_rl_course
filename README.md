# RL in Depth
lambda_kl = 0.1
lambda_h = 0.2

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning (RL) workshop! In this class, you will 
embark on an exciting three-day journey to deepen your understanding of RL by 
applying advanced concepts to a real-world robotics challenge. 
Our goal is to design and deploy an RL-based solution that commands a 
two-wheeled robot, the **Duckiebot**, to navigate a real road environment 
successfully. 
This project will challenge your creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability 
to deploy solutions that consider the constraints of embedded systems on the 
robot.

Through this hands-on experience, you will gain practical insights into:
- Refining your understanding of Reinforcement Learning.
- Designing an RL agent suitable for controlling a two-wheeled robot.


## Organization

### Prerequisites (Docker)
First, you need to install docker (if you haven't already) by following the instructions in the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Then follow the instructions in the [Docker initialization](#docker-initialization) section to build and run the docker image.

### Day 1: Discovery and Exploration
- Students will familiarize themselves with the simulator that models the Duckiebot and train an RL agent using the provided instructions in [duckiesim.md](duckiesim/duckiesim.md) file. This file explains how to set up the environment and guides students through the first steps of training.

### Days 2 and 3: Development and Competition
- Over the next two days, the focus will shift to the development and refinement of the RL-based solution. Students will test their agents, improve their models, and prepare for the final competition.

### Competition
At the end of Day 3, the competition will take place on a **circuit unknown to the students**. The objective is to **finish the circuit in minimal time**. The group with the best-performing agent will earn a grade of 20, while others will "strive harder next year" (humor).

## RL Robot Project Evaluation Grid

### Project Presentation and Implementation (18 points)

The project presentation will be a concise demonstration of your work and approach. While slides are not required, you should prepare a well-structured verbal explanation of your methodology, technical choices, and results. Be ready to clearly articulate your reasoning, explain the challenges you encountered and how you overcame them, and demonstrate your understanding of the RL algorithms used. What matters most is the quality of your argumentation and your ability to critically analyze your own work, not the visual support.

| Criterion | Insufficient | Acceptable | Good | Excellent |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Clarity of approach** | Approach is confusing and difficult to follow | Approach is generally understandable but lacks structure | Approach is clear, logical and well-structured | Approach is perfectly articulated with exemplary logical progression |
| **Justification of technical choices** | Choices are not or poorly justified | Choices are partially justified without in-depth analysis | Choices are well justified with relevant analysis | Choices are perfectly justified with thorough critical analysis and considered alternatives |
| **Understanding of RL algorithms** | Superficial understanding of algorithms used | Good understanding of the basics of algorithms used | Strong mastery of algorithms with ability to explain | Deep mastery with critical analysis and understanding of nuances |
| **Experimentation and analysis** | Few or no experiments | Some experiments without in-depth analysis | Relevant experiments with results analysis | Systematic experiments with comparative analyses and relevant conclusions |
| **Future directions** | Unable to identify meaningful future work | Identifies basic next steps without clear justification | Proposes well-reasoned future directions based on results | Presents comprehensive, strategic future directions with clear prioritization informed by conclusions |
| **Code documentation** | Code poorly documented or not at all | Partially documented code | Well documented and organized code | Exemplary, perfectly documented and structured code |

### Competition (2 points)

| Position | Score |
|----------|---------------|
| 1st place | 2 points |
| 2nd place | 1 points |
| 3rd place | 0 points |
