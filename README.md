# RL in Depth
lambda_kl = 0.1
lambda_h = 0.2

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning (RL) workshop! In this class, you will 
embark on an exciting three-day journey to deepen your understanding of RL by 
applying advanced concepts to a real-world robotics challenge. 
Our goal is to design and deploy an RL-based solution that commands a 
two-wheeled robot, the **Duckiebot**, to navigate a real road environment 
successfully. 
This project will challenge your creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability 
to deploy solutions that consider the constraints of embedded systems on the 
robot.

Through this hands-on experience, you will gain practical insights into:
- Refining your understanding of Reinforcement Learning.
- Designing an RL agent suitable for controlling a two-wheeled robot.
- Deploying and testing your solution on hardware, addressing real-world 
  constraints such as sensor limitations, latency, and computational resources.

## Organization

### Prerequisites (Docker)
First, you need to install docker (if you haven't already) by following the 
instructions in the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Then follow the instructions in the [Docker initialization](#docker-initialization) 
section to build and run the docker image.

### Day 1: Discovery and Exploration
- **Morning**: Students will familiarize themselves with the simulator that 
  models the Duckiebot and train an RL agent using the provided instructions in 
  [duckiesim.md](duckiesim/duckiesim.md) file. This file explains how to set up 
  the environment and guides students through the first steps of training.
- **Afternoon**: Students will first get hands-on experience with the real 
  Duckiebots. Then, they will form groups to brainstorm and develop a solution 
  for automating the robot using RL. The entire process of deploying RL in the 
  real world is detailed in [duckiereal.md](duckiereal/duckiereal.md) file.

### Days 2 and 3: Development and Competition
- Over the next two days, the focus will shift to the development and refinement 
  of the RL-based solution. Students will test their agents, improve their 
  models, and prepare for the final competition.

### Competition
At the end of Day 3, the competition will take place on a **circuit unknown to 
the students**. The objective is to **finish the circuit in minimal time**. 
The group with the best-performing agent will earn a grade of 20, while others 
will "strive harder next year" (humor).

## Course Schedule

## RL Robot Project Evaluation Grid

### Project Presentation and Implementation (18 points)

The project presentation will be a concise demonstration of your work and 
approach. 
While slides are not required, you should prepare a well-structured verbal 
explanation of your methodology, technical choices, and results.
Be ready to clearly articulate your reasoning, explain the challenges you 
encountered and how you overcame them, and demonstrate your understanding of 
the RL algorithms used. What matters most is the quality of your argumentation 
and your ability to critically analyze your own work, not the visual support.

| Criterion | Insufficient | Acceptable | Good | Excellent |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Clarity of approach** | Approach is confusing and difficult to follow | Approach is generally understandable but lacks structure | Approach is clear, logical and well-structured | Approach is perfectly articulated with exemplary logical progression |
| **Justification of technical choices** | Choices are not or poorly justified | Choices are partially justified without in-depth analysis | Choices are well justified with relevant analysis | Choices are perfectly justified with thorough critical analysis and considered alternatives |
| **Understanding of RL algorithms** | Superficial understanding of algorithms used | Good understanding of the basics of algorithms used | Strong mastery of algorithms with ability to explain | Deep mastery with critical analysis and understanding of nuances |
| **Experimentation and analysis** | Few or no experiments | Some experiments without in-depth analysis | Relevant experiments with results analysis | Systematic experiments with comparative analyses and relevant conclusions |
| **Future directions** | Unable to identify meaningful future work | Identifies basic next steps without clear justification | Proposes well-reasoned future directions based on results | Presents comprehensive, strategic future directions with clear prioritization informed by conclusions |
| **Code documentation** | Code poorly documented or not at all | Partially documented code | Well documented and organized code | Exemplary, perfectly documented and structured code |

### Competition (2 points)

| Position | Score |
|----------|---------------|
| 1st place | 2 points |
| 2nd place | 1 points |
| 3rd place | 0 points |

## Installation and general setup 

### Azure servers

Some of you might not have access to a GPU or cuda (mac users).
If this is not your case, you can skip this section.

For your ssh connection, set the '-Y' flag to forward the display to your 
local machine:

```shell
ssh -Y user@ip
```

TODO

### Docker container

If you are using Azure servers, follow these steps in it.
Otherwise, you have two solutions:
 - Install docker and run a container (recommended)
 - Install everything directly on your machine, then good luck, everything you 
   need to know is in the Dockerfile of this repository. 
   **Note that you will need ros1 which is not available for ubuntu22 and 24.**

Pull this repository (if not done)

```
git clone git@github.com:SuReLI/duckietown_rl_course.git && cd duckietown_rl_course
```

Install nvidia-docker2
```shell
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Build the Dockerfile
```shell
docker build -t indepthrl .
```

Run new image as a container
```shell
bash launch_container.sh
```
The current repository (duckietown_rl_course) has been mounted in the container.
Every modification here will also modify it in the container at /root/duckietown_rl_course

If you're not in azure server, start your container (`docker start -i duckietownrl`) then enter the following commands.
**In the first line, replace "paperino" by "gastone" if you use this robot, but you can still change it later.**
```shell
export ROBOT_NAME="paperino" && \
apt update -y && apt install -y dbus avahi-daemon iputils-ping && \
echo "service dbus start" >> /root/.bashrc && \
echo "service avahi-daemon start" >> /root/.bashrc && \
echo "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://\$ROBOT_NAME.local:11311/" >> /root/.bashrc && \
echo "export ROS_IP=\$(hostname -I | awk '{print \$1}')" >> /root/.bashrc && \
echo "export ROS_HOSTNAME=\$ROS_IP" >> /root/.bashrc && \
. ~/.bashrc
```

Then you can:
 - View the status of your container using `docker ps -a`
 - Start the container using `docker start -i indepthrl_container` Only if the container is not already "Up".
 - Go back inside the container using `docker exec -it indepthrl_container /bin/bash` Only if the container is already "Up".
**But `bash launch_container.sh` already do this, it will check the container status and start it or execute it as needed.**

Now, test that:
 - The simulator work with `python3 duckiesim/manual/manual_control.py`
 - You can communicate with the robot:
```shell
export ROBOT_NAME=<paperino/gastone>
rostopic list
```

If you have a long (like more than 10) list of topic with some of them starting with /$ROBOT_NAME/, then you're good. 
Otherwise, go to duckireal/help.md.
